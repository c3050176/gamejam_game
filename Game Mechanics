Core Mechanics:
-Check the information of the Package/Letter
-Check the Houses of the potential customers
-Buy evidences with time
-Deliver
(30s for each delivery, failed if there is no time left, wrong delivery also costs time)
(3 warning mails will get you fired and the game is over:
*failed deliveries will get you a warning mail
*customer complaints will get you a warning mail
*violating the company rules will get you a warning mail)


Elements Needed:
-Start button/Quit button
-Check package button
-House view button
-Time
-Ask the neibour button
-Deliver button

Random Events:
-Female customers in an Asian community are frequently complained about for having “hard-to-find addresses,” so the company set a rule to charge an additional delivery fee for every package in this area.
  (follow the rules/ignore the rules and you may get a warning mail)
-The player discovers a package that may be linked to illegal activities (e.g., containing discriminatory or violent content), but returning it directly might violate company policies.
  (complete the delivery/choose not to deliver and you may get a warning mail)
